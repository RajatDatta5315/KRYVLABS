-- This seed data is for demonstration and assumes a user is already authenticated.
-- You would need to replace the `owner_id` with an actual user's UUID from your `auth.users` table.

-- To get a user ID, you can sign up in the app and then run:
-- SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';

-- Example INSERT, replace with a real owner_id
-- INSERT INTO public.agents (owner_id, name, model, system_prompt, status)
-- VALUES
--   ('YOUR_USER_UUID_HERE', 'NEURAL_PHX-01', 'gpt-4o', 'You are a master data analyst. Provide concise, accurate reports.', 'idle'),
--   ('YOUR_USER_UUID_HERE', 'KRYV-CORE-7', 'gpt-4-turbo', 'You are a creative writer, tasked with generating innovative ideas.', 'offline');
